If you want to add a new language just put a flag image in this directory.

I got all my flags from www.blueflash.de - Unfortunately the images are no
longer available there but you can still get them from the Webarchive at:
http://web.archive.org/web/20020205113643/www.blueflash.de/flaggen/landlist.html

Please email videodb-devel@lists.sf.net if you want your flag to be included in 
the standard distribution.

Note:

To limit the number of flags displayed in the options dialog, a number of flags 
has been moved into the additional folder. To use these flags, they must be
copied to the images/flags folder.
