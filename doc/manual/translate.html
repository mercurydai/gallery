<h1>Development</h1>

<h2>Languages</h2>

<p>VideoDB already comes with a lot of languages, but if your's isn't supported why don't you become a translator?</p>

<p>The first thing you should do is to join the <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/videodb-devel" target="_blank">Developer Mailinglist</a> at SourceForge to stay informed when new language strings are added.</p>

<p>To create a new language file just copy the <code>en.php</code> file in the <code>language</code> directory and translate the all the contained strings to your language. I think you'll get the system when you have a look at it ;-).<br />
However pay attention to the <code>$lang[encoding]</code> field. This contains the character encoding you used in the file. You may use another encoding than <code>iso-8859-1</code>. See the <code>bg.php</code> as an example.<br />
You should adjust the the header at the top of the file to reflect your authorship, too. ;-). When updating or correcting a file of someone else just add another <code>@author</code> line with your name.</p>

<p>After translation you should send the file to the mailing list to be included in the next release.</p>

<p>Sometimes translations get slightly behind the english version. Missing translations will are always replaced by the english strings.</p>

<p>Hint: The <a href="contrib.html#langcheck">langcheck.php</a> tool can be very helpful to see a list of missing translations</p>
