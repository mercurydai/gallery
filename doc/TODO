Here are some things that still have to be done. I add my thoughts
about them, too. So you have an idea how likely you will see them
in the next version. 
If you want to do some of them *please* do so! I'm drowning in work.

This file is always slightly out of date - to have full insight in
the ongoing development process join the mailing list!

* Template-Creation HOWTO
  - which variables are available in which template and so on

* Update/Add language files
  - Yes please do so! You may even correct my bad english!

* Export-Function
  - There were some user with ideas for this
  - export current shown list (browse, search) or all to txt,
    pdf, csv ...
  - Is this really needed? what for?
  - there is mklist.pl in the contrib dir...

* Platform-Independent CD-Scanner to add files
  - I currently use videoadd.pl for that but it depends on perl
    and mplayer
  - a small JAVA tool would be really cool I could write one but I
    don't know of any java libs to extract video infos from files
  - No, there will be no PHP Disk browser in VideoDB - my webserver
    does not even have a CDROM drive
  - There is some Database for DVD like CDDB for AudioCDs it should
    be used, too
